# APP-BIM

The term Building Information Modeling (BIM for short) describes a working method for the networked planning, construction and management of buildings and other structures using software. All relevant building data is digitally modeled, combined and recorded. The structure is also visualized geometrically as a virtual model (computer model). Building Information Modeling is used both in the construction industry for construction planning and execution as well as in facility management.
